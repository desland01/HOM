# Changelog

All notable changes to the Homeowner Marketers project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- **Service Deep Dive Pages (app/services/*):** Created three new long-form service breakdown pages following a progressive disclosure pattern:
  - `/services/gbp-management`: Explains the math of the Google Map Pack, review velocity engines, and constant activity strategies.
  - `/services/ai-automations`: Details the Missed Call Text Back, AI web chat, and automated booking infrastructure.
  - `/services/citation-cleanup`: Highlights the human-led NAP data audit and syndication process.
- **Global Footer (components/layout/footer.tsx):** Implemented a new site-wide footer providing persistent navigation to the core methodology playbook and the new service deep-dive pages. Added standard brand contact information and a copyright bar. Included via `app/layout.tsx`.
- **Progressive Disclosure Links:** Integrated smart nested links throughout the marketing copy to push interested users towards the new service pages. Added contextual links to the `PlaybookPage` ("View Citation Strategy", "View Reputation Engine") and the `AddOnsAndBundles` component cards.

### Changed
- **Service Pages Hero Styling (app/services/*, app/playbook/page.tsx):** Upgraded the hero sections on the Playbook and all three deep-dive service pages. Swapped standard padding (`pt-32 pb-24`) for a full-screen layout (`min-h-[100svh] flex flex-col justify-center`) to match the massive, Webflow-inspired "machined" aesthetic of the main homepage. Increased headline sizes to `text-6xl sm:text-8xl lg:text-9xl` and constrained the width (`max-w-[15ch]`) to force aggressive, dramatic line breaks. Constrained body copy width (`max-w-3xl`) for superior readability on large desktop monitors.
- **Methodology Playbook Page (app/playbook/page.tsx):** Created a dedicated, long-form manual page (`/playbook`) breaking down the exact SEO methodologies (Geo-Silos, A.E.O., Reverse Silos, Automations, Edge Hosting). Designed with the "machined" brand aesthetic and utilizing the Hormozi-Sanchez copywriting framework to explain the agentic unfair advantage.
- **Root Layout Constraint (app/layout.tsx):** Updated body structure to `flex flex-col min-h-screen` and wrapped `children` in a `flex-grow` container to ensure the new global footer always rests at the bottom of the viewport, even on short pages like the new service manuals.
- **Removed Main Wrapper Padding (app/page.tsx):** Removed the previous mobile-only padding (`pb-24 lg:pb-0`) from the `<main>` tag, as the global footer now inherently provides the necessary clearance for the fixed bottom CTA.
- **Transparency Policy Section (page.tsx):** Added a new prominent section right before the Pilot Packages detailing our Unfair Advantage strategy. The CTA now directs users to the full playbook page instead of a modal.

### Changed
- **AI Chat Widget Tier Adjustment (page.tsx, comparison-table.tsx, offer-options.md):** Added AI Chat Widget integration to Tier 2 with a usage cap of 100 conversations per month to help mid-tier businesses capture after-hours leads. Updated Tier 3 to explicitly emphasize "UNLIMITED" chat widget conversations.
- **Location Hubs Naming Convention (page.tsx, comparison-table.tsx, offer-options.md):** Combined "Primary City Hub" and "Secondary Location Hubs" into a single unified "Location Hubs" term across all marketing materials and documentation. Updated Tier 2 count from "3 additional" to "4 total (main city + 3 additional hubs)" for clarity.
- **A La Carte Pricing & Descriptions (add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Updated "Citation Clean-Up" price to $699 and revised the description to emphasize it requires a human touch and is only needed for messy citations. Renamed "Google Profile Setup" to "Additional Google Profile" and clarified that the first location is already included in the build plan.
- **Removed Policy Modal (page.tsx):** Removed the progressive disclosure modal for the transparency policy, opting instead for the dedicated `/playbook` page to provide a more comprehensive "manual-style" reading experience.
- **Offer Tiers and Add-ons Restructure (offer-options.md, page.tsx, comparison-table.tsx, add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Decoupled the initial one-time build fee from monthly growth engines. Rewrote all tier and pricing logic to emphasize the flexibility of choosing a build tier and pairing it with an appropriate recurring package. Upgraded the underlying integrations (now prominently featuring proprietary citation and AI chat/review management engines).
- **Sticky Features Mobile Lock-In Fix (sticky-features.tsx):** Completely redesigned the final sticky card tracking mechanism. Reverted the wrapper to `h-[100svh]` to give the containing block the necessary scroll space, and moved the `sticky` property down to the inner card wrapper. Removed the generic padding (`pb-[50vh]`) from the main section container. This creates a perfect native CSS interaction where the last card remains solidly locked in place while the "Proven Results" section physically slides up to touch its bottom edge before seamlessly pushing it out of the viewport.


### Added
- **A.E.O. Optimization Feature (comparison-table.tsx, sticky-features.tsx, page.tsx):** Added Answer Engine Optimization (A.E.O.) as a tiered feature across the landing page. Tier 2 gets basic AI search optimization (answer capsules, core schema markup). Tier 3 gets the full A.E.O. suite (advanced schema, cross-platform presence, AI bot optimization, competitive monitoring). New "AI Optimization" section in the comparison table with 2 rows and an educational modal explaining how we optimize client sites for LLM citation by ChatGPT, Google AI, and Perplexity. Updated Feature 01 "Own Your City" sticky card to explicitly reference A.E.O. methodology.

### Changed
- **A.E.O. Redistributed Across All 3 Tiers (comparison-table.tsx, sticky-features.tsx, page.tsx):** Every tier now includes A.E.O. features instead of starting at Tier 2. Tier 1 gets Basic A.E.O. (answer capsules, core schema, content freshness). Tier 2 gets Advanced A.E.O. (FAQPage + Service schema, expert attribution, AI bot optimization, llms.txt). Tier 3 keeps the Full A.E.O. Suite (HowTo + Review + VideoObject schema, cross-platform presence on 4+ platforms, competitive AI citation monitoring). Updated comparison table rows from xmark/Basic/Full Suite to Basic/Advanced/Full Suite. Updated schema row from xmark/Core/Advanced to Core/Extended/Full Suite. Added Basic A.E.O. bullet to Tier 1 card. Updated Tier 2 bullet to reflect advanced tier. Updated sticky features modal descriptions to match new distribution.

### Fixed
- **Add-On Cards Hover Layout Thrashing (add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Removed the `-translate-y-2` standard CSS hover utility from all mapped cards under the "Stack the Deck" section. The combination of grid/flex layouts and the translation was causing the parent container boundaries to violently resize on hover, resulting in a jarring pop/flash effect. The cards now rely entirely on their stable `shadow-xl` / `shadow-2xl` hover transitions for interactive feedback, ensuring a smooth, unbroken layout.
- **Mobile Problem Cards Animation (page.tsx):** Resticted the scroll-activated dark mode transition on the "Your Website is Costing You Money" problem cards strictly to mobile viewports (`<1024px`). Desktop viewports now rely exclusively on the standard hover interactions, preventing the jarring flashing effect when scrolling on larger screens.
- **iOS Mobile Scroll Lag (layout.tsx, page.tsx, sticky-features.tsx):** Resolved jerky scroll and layout thrashing on iOS devices caused by the native address bar expanding/collapsing. Changed `scroll-smooth` to `md:scroll-smooth` in `layout.tsx` to prevent CSS smooth scroll from conflicting with iOS momentum scroll. Replaced dynamic `dvh` units with static `svh` units (`min-h-[100svh]`, `min-h-[85svh]`, `min-h-[60svh]`) across main layouts and sticky wrappers to prevent browser resize events from forcing Framer Motion to recalculate layout mid-scroll. Removed `snap-start` from sticky cards to decouple from native snapping behavior.
- **Sticky Card Position Drift on Mobile (sticky-features.tsx):** Replaced per-card top offset (`calc(-10vh + ${i * 25}px)`) with a fixed value (`calc(-10vh + 75px)`) so all 4 cards stop at the same viewport position. Compressed fade-out to 40% of step duration to eliminate previous-card text bleed-through. Last card now keeps full scale (no shrink). Increased container bottom padding from `pb-[10vh]` to `pb-[30vh]` for a clean push-out exit.
- **Marquee Text Overlap on Mobile (page.tsx):** Replaced `min-w-full justify-around` with `shrink-0` on both track divs and all span items so marquee text never compresses on narrow viewports. Removed `ml-12` from the duplicate track. Fixes text overlapping at 375px and eliminates the snap-back loop artifact.
- **Mobile Banner Overlap (layout.tsx, page.tsx):** Removed static `pt-12` from body and moved clearance into the hero section with proper banner-aware padding (`pt-[72px]` when banner shown, `pt-6` when hidden; `lg:pt-24`/`lg:pt-16` on desktop). Eliminates the 8px gap between the 56px fixed banner and the old 48px body padding, and responds dynamically when the banner is dismissed.
- **Footer Overlap from Fixed CTA (page.tsx):** Added `pb-24 lg:pb-0` to `<main>` so the fixed bottom "Check Availability" bar no longer covers footer content on mobile.
- **Sticky Card Text Bleed-Through (sticky-features.tsx):** Added scroll-driven fade-out so each stacking card's text disappears as the next card overlaps it. Split the single `opacity` into `fadeIn` (entrance) x `fadeOut` (exit driven by parent scroll progress). Last card never fades out.
- **Hero Bottom Overlap on Mobile (page.tsx):** The 50% OFF card's transformed shadow elements (`translate-y-8` + `blur-xl` = ~56px visual overflow) bled into the marquee strip below. Increased hero bottom padding from `pb-8` (32px) to `pb-20` (80px) on mobile. Changed `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-clip` to prevent Safari from letting CSS-transformed elements escape the clipping boundary.

### Changed
- **Sticky Features to Portfolio Transition (page.tsx):** Removed bottom padding (`pb-24 lg:pb-40`) from "The Solution" section so the following "Proven Results" (Portfolio) section seamlessly slides up and physically pushes the final "Instant Load Speed" sticky card out of the viewport. Eliminates the previous blank gap and creates a continuous scrolling narrative.
- **Pilot Packages (page.tsx):** Removed the revenue qualifier (e.g., "Painters doing $250k - $500k") from the `TierCard` components and updated the layout margin to maintain proper spacing.
- **Problem Cards Layout (page.tsx):** Updated the `ProblemCard` component to use a flex layout, placing the "x" icon inline with the title to reduce dead space and create a tighter, more cohesive card structure.

### Fixed
- **Problem Cards Transition (page.tsx):** Refactored the "Your Website is costing you money" cards to use a centralized scroll event listener (`ProblemCardsList`). Replaced individual `useInView` triggers with a unified system that calculates distance to the viewport center, ensuring that **only one card** transitions to the active/dark state at a time, creating a smoother reading experience.

### Fixed
- **Sticky Stacking Cards Broken by Overflow (page.tsx):** Changed `overflow-hidden` to `overflow-clip` on the "The Solution" parent section. `overflow-hidden` creates a new scroll container which confines `position: sticky` to that container instead of the viewport, completely breaking the stacking card animation on both mobile and desktop. `overflow-clip` still clips decorative background elements but does not create a scroll container, allowing sticky positioning to work correctly against the viewport.
- **Mobile Sticky Feature Complete Rebuild (sticky-features.tsx):** Scrapped the Framer Motion `useScroll` mapping math entirely due to lingering cross-device layout bugs. Rebuilt the stacking card animation from scratch using native CSS `position: sticky`. Implemented oversized `h-[130dvh]` scrolling wrappers per card to control reading pacing perfectly without JS layout thrashing. Cards now slide up and stick sequentially at offset `top` values using pure CSS, guaranteeing buttery smooth native performance on all mobile browsers regardless of address bar resizing. Added deep custom drop shadows to separate overlapping cards natively.
- **Mobile Problem Cards Hover (page.tsx):** Replaced static desktop `hover` classes with Framer Motion's `useInView` to automatically trigger the dark/light card transition on mobile devices when a card scrolls into the middle 40% of the viewport. Preserved standard hover interactions on desktop viewports.

### Fixed
- **Mobile Animation Architecture (animations.tsx, sticky-features.tsx, layout.tsx):** Rebuilt the scroll-linked animations to resolve mobile judder and layout thrashing. Removed `snap-y snap-proximity` from `layout.tsx` and replaced CSS scroll snapping (`snap-start`) in `sticky-features.tsx` with a Framer Motion "Scroll Track" pattern driven purely by `transform` (GPU). Replaced CPU-bound `useSpring` in `Parallax` with direct `y` transforms to prevent scroll lag. Added explicit `willChange: "transform, opacity"` hardware acceleration tags to all global animation wrappers (`FadeIn`, `ScaleReveal`, `TextReveal`).

### Fixed
- **Hero Above-Fold CRO (page.tsx):** Compressed hero section vertical spacing so all elements (logo, badge, headline, body text, CTA, and 50% OFF card) fit above the fold at both mobile (375x812) and desktop (1440x900). Reduced desktop headline from text-9xl/text-10xl to text-7xl/text-8xl and widened max-width from 15ch to 25ch on lg+ to collapse from 4 lines to 2. Tightened section padding, element margins, grid gaps, and card padding across both viewports. Verified via Playwright: mobile overflow -11px (within fold), desktop overflow -229px (229px headroom).
- **Sticky Features Mobile CRO (sticky-features.tsx):** Optimized "The Solution" sticky cards for mobile viewports by making them stretch vertically (`min-h-[85dvh]` on mobile vs `min-h-0` on desktop). Applied `flex-grow` to inner content and `mt-auto` to the CTA button to distribute internal space evenly and push the button to the bottom. This prevents massive blank gaps between cards when scrolling on small screens and aligns with the visual requirement to make cards "stretch more to fit".
- **Comparison Table CRO (comparison-table.tsx, feature-modal.tsx):** Audited and fixed 6 visual CRO issues across mobile (375x812) and desktop (1440x900). Enlarged info "i" button touch targets from 20px to 48px using an invisible 48px hit area with negative margin (`w-12 h-12 -m-3.5`) while preserving the 20px visual circle. Added a right-edge gradient scroll indicator (`lg:hidden`) so mobile users can see the table scrolls horizontally. Bumped all table cell text from `text-[15px]` (15px) to `text-base` (16px) for WCAG/CRO body text minimum compliance. Enlarged modal close button from `w-8 h-8` (32px) to `w-12 h-12` (48px) for touch target compliance. Added proper `TableRowProps` TypeScript interface replacing `any` type. Increased row hover opacity from 2% to 4% for visible desktop feedback.
- **Add-Ons Visual CRO (add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Audited and fixed 10 visual CRO issues across mobile (375x812) and desktop (1440x900). Bumped SEO plan feature text, A La Carte descriptions, and bundle descriptions from `text-xs` (12px) to `text-sm` (14px) for WCAG readability compliance. Raised "Recommended" badges and bundle savings text from `text-[10px]` to `text-xs` (12px minimum). Fixed "Best Value" badge clipping by changing `-right-4` to `right-4` to stay within overflow-hidden parent. Reduced sticky sidebar offset from `lg:top-40` (160px) to `lg:top-24` (96px) for proper clearance with fixed 56px banner. Improved contrast on section subtitle (charcoal/50 to /60), bundle original price (charcoal/30 to /50, also bumped to text-sm), and A La Carte descriptions (charcoal/60 to /70). Added responsive tracking and font size on AI tool titles (`text-base sm:text-lg`, `tracking-wider sm:tracking-widest`) to prevent awkward wrapping at 375px.
- **Portfolio Viewports CRO (portfolio-viewports.tsx):** Fixed WCAG-violating text sizes on "Scroll Site" overlay (`text-[8px] sm:text-[10px]` raised to `text-xs` / 12px minimum). Added `py-3` to portfolio name links for 48px touch target compliance. Added `leading-relaxed` to description text for 1.5 line-height on multi-line body copy. Left-aligned description paragraph on mobile to prevent centered multi-line text. Removed dead `useScroll`/`useTransform` code and unused imports.

### Added
- **Portfolio Viewports (portfolio-viewports.tsx, page.tsx):** Added a new "Proven Results" section directly above "Pilot Packages" featuring macOS-style browser window components. These windows embed scrollable iframes showcasing sample high-performance websites built for painters. The section employs Framer Motion for entrance animations (`ScaleReveal`) and subtle hover interactions, matching the overarching "machined" brand aesthetic.

### Changed
- **Copy Update (page.tsx):** Changed primary CTA texts from "See If You Qualify" and "Let's Talk" to "Check Availability" across the hero section, the oversized bottom CTA, and the mobile fixed bottom banner for higher conversion intent.
- **Add-Ons Visuals & Layout (add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Added hover animations (`-translate-y-2`, shadows, border color shifts) to all cards in the "STACK THE DECK" section (Maintenance Plans, SEO Plans, AI Tools, A La Carte, and Bundle items) to match the project's machined Vibe Coding aesthetic. Also detached the "Bundle and Save" card from its parent sticky container and made the card itself sticky (`lg:sticky lg:top-24`), allowing it to persist independently on scroll.
- **Logo (page.tsx):** Increased the size of the top hero and bottom footer logos (`HM-Logo.png`) to improve visibility and presence on both desktop and mobile viewports.
- **Portfolio Viewports (portfolio-viewports.tsx):** Converted the portfolio item titles (e.g., "Grove Street Painting") into clickable anchor tags that link directly to the live websites in a new tab. Added an interactive hover state with color transitions and a sliding arrow (`↗`) to indicate the external link.
- **Portfolio Viewports (portfolio-viewports.tsx):** Removed the macOS-style browser header (traffic light buttons and URL bar) from the viewport windows to create a cleaner, border-only frame around the embedded sites.
- **Portfolio Viewports (portfolio-viewports.tsx):** Enlarged the viewport windows to take up all available horizontal site space by removing the `max-w-5xl` container constraint, allowing them to expand seamlessly within the global `1440px` bounds. Increased the horizontal gap (`lg:gap-20`) to maintain a clean, uncrowded layout as they scale up.
- **Portfolio Viewports (portfolio-viewports.tsx):** Changed the iframe container aspect ratio to `aspect-video` (16:9) to resemble a true desktop monitor. Applied a CSS scaling technique (`w-[300%]`, `scale(0.333333)`) to the embedded iframes so they trigger and render their desktop layouts perfectly, regardless of the user's current screen size.
- **Portfolio Viewports:** Updated the sample websites in the `PortfolioViewports` section to point to actual live sites (`grovestreetpainting.com` and `shape-of-paint.vercel.app`) instead of placeholder data. Adjusted the layout grid from 3 columns to 2 columns to perfectly center and frame the two active examples.
- **Mobile CRO (page.tsx):** Changed the fixed bottom CTA background color on mobile from Charcoal (`bg-brand-charcoal` / `text-brand-ivory`) to Mustard (`bg-brand-mustard` / `text-brand-charcoal`) for higher contrast and click-through visibility.
- **Sticky Features Styling (sticky-features.tsx, tailwind.config.ts):** Refined the `animate-ember` glow on the "See Tier Details +" buttons. Increased the animation speed by 50% (3s to 1.5s), increased the base/peak opacity by ~20%, and adjusted the glow positioning (`inset-[-2px] border-2`) so it emits directly from the button's border rather than filling the background space.
- **Sticky Features Layout (page.tsx):** Increased the spacing between the "LOOK LIKE THE BEST" section header and the start of the `StickyFeatures` component (from `mb-12` to `mb-24 lg:mb-40`). This ensures the first card has the same isolated viewpoint dominance as the rest of the cards when it snaps into place, rather than overlapping with the section title.
- **Sticky Features Scroll Snapping (layout.tsx, sticky-features.tsx):** Implemented native CSS scroll snapping. Added `snap-y snap-proximity` to the global `html` layout and `snap-start` to each "The Solution" card wrapper. This creates a persistent scroll that auto-stops perfectly when the user scrolls a card into its sticky position.
- **Copy Update (page.tsx):** Updated the Solution section heading from "LOOK LIKE THE BEST. CHARGE LIKE THE BEST." to "LOOK LIKE THE BEST - CHARGE LIKE THE BEST." per the user's request.
- **Sticky Features Animation (sticky-features.tsx):** Refined the entrance animation of "The Solution" cards. Removed the blur effect entirely and increased the entrance zoom scale (starting from 0.6 instead of 0.8) to make the "zoom and lock into place" feel more pronounced and snappy.
- **Guarantees Section Copy Rewrite (guarantees.tsx):** Rewrote all copy in the guarantees section using Hormozi-Sanchez risk-reversal methodology. Updated all 6 guaranteeDetails modal entries (top-3, pagespeed, risk-free, walk-away, delivery, approval) with progressive 3-step stories where each step tells a unique part of the guarantee narrative. Rewrote all 6 guarantee card titles and descriptions to maximize "no way I can lose" framing. Section header changed from "THE 'NO B.S.' GUARANTEE STACK." to "SIX GUARANTEES. ZERO RISK. ALL YOURS." Label changed from "Our Promises" to "You Risk Nothing." All copy at 5th grade reading level, you/your dominant voice, ASCII only, zero tech jargon. Specific penalties named throughout (work free, fix free, 20% off, keep everything).
- **Hormozi-Sanchez Copy Rewrite (add-ons-and-bundles.tsx):** Rewrote all copy strings in the add-ons section using Hormozi-Sanchez value-stacking methodology. Maintenance plan features now describe outcomes ("Your site stays online 24/7") instead of features ("24/7 Uptime Monitoring"). SEO plan features rewritten to sell Google visibility results. Fixed Enterprise tier's broken warning-style features ("Impact fades without Ultimate Arsenal") with actual value props. AI tool descriptions now frame around lost revenue ($5,000 missed call) and 24/7 availability. Bundle descriptions sell the combined outcome instead of listing ingredients. A la carte items each sell an outcome in one sentence. Section headers refreshed ("STACK THE DECK." / "Add More Firepower"). Sub-headers rewritten to outcome-oriented language ("Keep It Running", "Get Found First", "Never Miss A Lead", "Pick What You Need", "Bundle And Save"). All copy at 5th grade reading level, you/your dominant, ASCII only, zero tech jargon. Renamed "Enterprise Takeover" to "Total Takeover". Renamed "Google Business Profile Setup" to "Google Profile Setup".
- **Hormozi-Sanchez Copy Rewrite (page.tsx):** Rewrote all user-facing copy strings using direct-response methodology grounded in the brand messaging playbook. Hero headline changed to "STOP LOOKING CHEAP. START CHARGING MORE." Problem cards rewritten with painter-specific pain language. All tier feature lists now sell outcomes instead of tech features. Removed all remaining jargon (Geo-Silo, GBP entity synchronization, reverse-silo, DataForSEO). CTAs shifted to "See If You Qualify" and "Let's Talk" for higher conversion intent. Solution header changed to "LOOK LIKE THE BEST. CHARGE LIKE THE BEST." Tier names updated to Neighborhood Pro, City Dominator, Metro Takeover. All copy at 5th grade reading level, you/your dominant voice, ASCII only.
- **Comparison Table Copy Overhaul:** Rewrote all 6 featureDetails modal entries (titles, descriptions, and tier strings) in `comparison-table.tsx` using Hormozi-Sanchez methodology. Fixed critical bug where page-speed tiers had 3 identical lines. Replaced all tech jargon (Geo-Silo, reverse-silo, NAP, DataForSEO, GBP entity sync) with plain-language benefit copy. Updated section header from "SIDE BY SIDE." to "NO SURPRISES." with refreshed subtitle.
- **Global Copy Rewrite:** Stripped out tech jargon (Next.js, Vercel, React, JSON-LD) across `app/page.tsx`, `components/ui/sticky-features.tsx`, `components/sections/comparison-table.tsx`, and `components/sections/guarantees.tsx`. Realigned all user-facing text to speak directly to painting contractors (e.g. "Stop looking like the guy with a van", "Filter the tire-kickers", "High-Performance Architecture").
- Rewrote `docs/core-message.md` to aggressively strip out tech jargon (Agentic Engineering, Netflix-tier, etc.) and realign the messaging to speak directly to blue-collar painting business owners.
- Restructured `docs/core-message.md` into a formal brand messaging architecture, highlighting de-commoditization, Agentic Engineering USPs, and the funnel architecture.
- **Messaging Pivot:** Shifted core offer messaging from "no 12-month lock-ins" to "paying for speed and precision." Emphasized that 90-day proof engine transitions into a mandatory 12-month recurring growth plan.
- Updated `components/sections/add-ons-and-bundles.tsx` to explicitly state that the Enterprise Takeover tier indexes 50 pages at once for max start velocity.

### Added
- Created `docs/core-message.md` to formalize the brand's unique selling propositions, positioning strategy, and pricing funnel (speed over commodity).
- Added `components/sections/add-ons-and-bundles.tsx` to showcase optional upgrades like Website Maintenance, SEO Growth Plans, AI Tools, Bundles, and A La Carte services.
- Created `docs/offer-options.md` synthesizing all components of the "Pilot Offer" from existing project documents (Next.js build details, 90-day proof period, and pricing tiers).
- Copied `docs/offer-options.md` to `~/.claude/` to serve as a shared global context.

### Changed
- Rewrote `docs/offer-options.md` with a non-technical TLDR, detailed component explainers, market-comparable pricing tiers, and explicit ownership/buyout clauses.

### Added
- Added `components/ui/feature-modal.tsx` to handle progressive disclosure of tier-specific feature details.
- Added `components/ui/guarantee-modal.tsx` with a 3-step animated carousel (page-turn on desktop, swipe on mobile) to explain guarantees in depth.
- Imported `SITE-STRUCTURE-PLAN.md` into the `docs` folder as a reference artifact.
- Established the **Vibe Coding Protocol** in `GEMINI.md` and `CLAUDE.md`, officially designating the User as the Product Manager/Creative Director and the AI as the Senior Autonomous Developer.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to track project history.
- Set up a git post-commit hook to automatically encourage changelog updates or log git activity.
- Created `components/ui/animations.tsx` to act as a centralized, Webflow-inspired animation library (Framer Motion).
- Added `FadeIn`, `TextReveal`, `Parallax`, `Magnetic`, and `ScaleReveal` reusable animation wrappers.
- Created `components/ui/sticky-features.tsx` for a 3D sticky stacking card effect on the features section.
- Added an infinite CSS marquee strip below the hero section.
- Migrated and redesigned the `ComparisonTable` and `Guarantees` sections from the original HTML into modular React components (`components/sections/`).

### Changed
- **Copywriting:** Applied the Hormozi-Sanchez framework across the landing page to create punchy, high-contrast, value-first hooks (e.g., "WE BUILD THE MACHINE. YOU COUNT THE LEADS.").
- **Guarantees:** Redesigned the "Our Promises" section into clickable cards that trigger deep-dive modals. Added a 6th "Top 3 Or We Work Free" guarantee with a custom SVG chalk double-underline.
- **Features:** Updated `StickyFeatures` with buttons linking to deep-dive `FeatureModal` popups for each section.
- **Design System:** Transitioned the site to a Webflow "machined" aesthetic with oversized typography (up to `text-10xl`), tight tracking, and heavy borders.
- **Hero Section:** Upgraded the "50% OFF" badge with a 3D rotation spring animation on hover.
- **Layout:** Converted "The Problem" and "Pilot Packages" sections to use a modern side-by-side sticky scroll layout.
- **Mobile CRO:** Replaced all `h-screen` classes with `100dvh` to fix mobile browser jumpiness.
- **Mobile CRO:** Scaled down massive typography (`text-10xl` -> `text-5xl`) on mobile breakpoints to prevent horizontal overflow on 375px screens.
- **Accessibility:** Upgraded all `text-[10px]` utility classes to `text-xs` (12px) to meet baseline mobile legibility standards.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` and created `CLAUDE.md` to establish firm guidelines on the animation architecture, Webflow vibe, and mobile CRO standards.
