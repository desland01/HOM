## 3. Ownership & Exit Options

We believe in earned loyalty, not "hostage" contracts. You have two ways to own your digital asset outright:

### The "Full Ownership" Upfront Option
If you prefer to own the asset immediately without a 90-day proof period or monthly commitment:
*   **Price:** 1.5x the Retail Value of your chosen tier (e.g., $6,750 for Tier 1).
*   **Benefit:** Immediate transfer of all code, assets, and hosting. No monthly marketing fees required.

### The "Contract Buyout" Clause (Take the Site With You)
If you are in a growth contract (Month 4+) and want to leave while keeping the website:
*   **Formula:** Remaining months on contract × 50% + a **$1,500 Technical Transfer Fee**.
*   **Terms:** We hand over the keys to the Next.js repository and Vercel hosting. We handle the technical migration to your own accounts to ensure nothing breaks.

### The "90-Day Walkaway" (Zero Cost Exit)
*   If leads don't materialize during the 90-day Proof Period, you pay nothing more. We point your domain back to your old site, and we part ways as friends.
